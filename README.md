## Step 2 : Step 2 - Add Unit Tests

Make sure to add the unit test code as shown in the screenshot

// Add a picture showing how the calculator.py file should look like

```
def test_add():
    assert add(1,1) == 2

def test_sub():
    assert sub(1,1) == 0

def test_mul():
    assert mul(1,1) == 1
